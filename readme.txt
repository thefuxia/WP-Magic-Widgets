Assigns widgets to action hooks.

== Description ==

Defines sidebar areas in `wp_head`, `wp_footer`, `admin_head` and `admin_footer`. You may extend the list. 

Additionally, the plugin creates a new widget, called *Unfiltered Text*. Very similar to the regular text widget, but it doesn’t insert any extra markup.
